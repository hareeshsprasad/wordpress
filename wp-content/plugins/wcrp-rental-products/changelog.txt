*** Rental Products Changelog ***

2024-05-01 - version 5.0.0
* Note: This is a milestone release, please ensure you read the contents of this changelog and we recommend performing this upgrade on a staging/development environment and testing before upgrading the extension on a production website, clear all caches after upgrading, if you don't currently have any issues with 4.4.2, you may wish to consider remaining on this release temporarily until you have tested 5.0.0+ with no issues and once further developments have been released since this milestone
* Note: This version includes several changes to cart/checkout related functionality, in part for cart/checkout block compatibility, before upgrading the extension on a production website and regardless of whether you are using the classic or block cart/checkout, we recommended testing the cart/checkout with your product availability/pricing scenarios on a staging/development environment
* Note: While we have strived to make this extension compatible with cart/checkout blocks, they are a relatively new development and issues may exist, for stability we currently recommend using the classic cart/checkout experience with this extension
* Note: This version includes WooCommerce Product Add-ons compatibility tweaks, WooCommerce Product Add-ons has had several functional changes and deprecations since the last compatiblity review, therefore if using add-ons for rental products it is recommended you ensure you are using the latest version of the WooCommerce Product Add-ons extension, and on a staging/development environment test products by viewing product pages, making test orders, reviewing order details, etc to ensure add-ons are still being applied as expected before upgrading both extensions on a production website

Due to this during the upgrade process if at site or product level you were previously using the non day price display setting and your minimum/maximum days settings were equal the prices you entered will be recalculated by multiplying the existing price per day by the days set to give a price for the period you were using, if you were using the non day pricing setting in any way we strongly recommend performing this upgrade on a staging environment and checking your pricing and rental settings before upgrading the extension on a production website

2020-08-10 - version 2.1.0
* Add: Forcing of manage stock, stock status and backorders settings for rental products, this ensures rental products bypass WooCommerce stock checks/reservation on cart/checkout, this is a requirement to ensure rental products can be purchased with this extension going forward, previously rental purchase products allowed stock statuses, levels and backorders, this has to be removed as the only way to bypass WooCommerce's checks is by backtracing WooCommerce's functions to manipulate the functionality in the absence of any filters, the previous method requires intense server resource/memory to complete and is therefore not feasible for use or continued development within this extension going forward. We have written and requested some filters to be included in WooCommerce however there is no guarantee that these will be added into WooCommerce and is WooCommerce's decision to include as they see fit inline with their development, if they do get included we will look at the feasibility of adding back manage stock, stock status and backorders to rental products in future.
